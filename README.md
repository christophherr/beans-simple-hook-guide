# Beans Simple Hook Guide

Find Beans action hooks quickly and easily by seeing their actual locations in your theme.

**Beans Theme Framework required.**

## Description

This is an adapted version of [Genesis Simple Hook Guide](https://sridharkatakam.com/genesis-simple-hook-guide/) by [Sridhar Katakam](https://github.com/srikat/).

- Hooks are dynamically generated vs being hardcoded
- Clicking anywhere on a hook selects the hook name ready to be easily copied
- Does not show filters or markup

For a more comprehensive solution, please see [Jeff Cleverley's](https://github.com/jeffcleverley) [Beans Visual Hook Guide](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beans-visual-hook-guide/)

Once installed, this plugin adds a dropdown menu to the admin bar to see the available hooks on the page being viewed in the front end.
